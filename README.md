# Inverse Nanoparticle Synthesis Modeling

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for inverse modeling of gold nanoparticle synthesis using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.

## Features

- Conditional generation of synthesis steps from morphology descriptors
- NLP-based modeling using transformers
- Integration of structured JSON data
- Evaluation using BLEU, ROUGE, and fuzzy matching

## File

- `Inverse_NP.ipynb`: Main notebook demonstrating inverse modeling pipeline

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab.
